# Study for Deep Learning
This area is really interesting!. But not main.
<br>I want to convergence with Cybersecurity.
<br>I'll be implement hacking detector with deep learning.
<br>
<br>If you have a nice idea or already do that, please share to me.


## ANN(Artificial Neural Network)
The basic of Deep Learning.
<br> Used for Regression and classification.
<br>We can do anything with ANN.
<br>Input -> hidden layer(usually (linear->relu)\*L-1) -> output layer

## CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
Used for Computer Vision
<br>Usually applied to analyzing visual imagery.
<br>Image -> Convolution -> Pooling -> flattening -> ANN

## RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)
Used for time series analysis.
<br>Usually applied to Natural Language Processing
<br>Input -> Recurrent -> ANN
