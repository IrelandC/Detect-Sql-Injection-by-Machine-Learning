# predict_stock_RNN.py
This python code is predict stock with LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory layer).
<br>You can understand how to handle data with [LSTM](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).
<br>If you have a good computing power(nice CPU or GPU) then add more LSTM layer and increase epochs.
<br>Maybe someone send e-mail to me with more upgraded model.
<br>Thanks :D
