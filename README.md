# Machine Learning
Study Machine Learning codes.
<br>Interesting Machine Learning.
<br>Please share your experience!

## SQL-Injection
<br>This python code is **detect sql injection** with **machine-learning**.
<br>I use classification method and GBT(Gradient Boosting Tree) algorithm.
<br>You can also use RandomForest, SVM, etc.(easy too use from sklearn.)


## DeepLearning
<br>This python code is **studycode** in **deep learning**.
<br>I'll update more interesting project like attack detector with deep learning in Cybersecurity.
